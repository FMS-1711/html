        Hidan is an S-rank missing-nin who defected from Yugakure and later joined the Akatsuki. 
        There, he was partnered with Kakuzu, despite the two's somewhat mutual dislike of each 
        other. He was also the second newest member of Akatsuki at the time of Tobi's introduction.
        Kisame Hoshigaki laughingly referred to Hidan and Kakuzu as the Zombie Combo .<br>
        During his childhood, after hearing rumours about the Valley of Hell, Hidan went and found
         it out of curiosity. There, he was disgusted by the smell of sulphur, and discovered 
         corpses all over the area. After returning and telling others of the corpses, they weren't 
         surprised that the Chinoike Clan couldn't survive living in the valley, prompting Hidan to 
         correct their assumptions and informing them that the bodies weren't skeletons but actual 
         bodies, with their blood not dry. His story led to people suspecting Hidan of murdering 
         them, as well as Yugakure ninja being dispatched to the area to investigate, during which they determined the slaughter to be a clan act.<br>
