        Sasori , renowned as Sasori of the Red Sand , was an S-rank missing-nin from Sunagakure's Puppet Brigade 
        and a member of Akatsuki, where he was partnered with Orochimaru and later Deidara.<br>
        When Sasori was young, his father and mother were killed by Sakumo Hatake in battle,
         leaving him in the care of his grandmother, Chiyo. When Chiyo attempted to cheer 
         him up by teaching him puppetry, Sasori's innate aptitude for the art became apparent,
          and he even began to devise masterful ways of eliminating a puppet master's weaknesses 
          in battle. His skills even allowed him to create two puppets in the image of his parents
           in an attempt to discard the terrible loneliness he felt. However, as the puppets were 
           unable to give him the real parental love that he desired, Sasori lost interest in them, 
           and they later fell into Chiyo's possession. Sasori created many other ingenious puppets,
            including Kuroari, Karasu, and Sansh≈çuo.<br>
