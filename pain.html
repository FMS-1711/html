    <h2 style="font-family:cursive ; background-image: url();color: aliceblue; font-size: 2cm;" ><ul><li> Nagato created the Six Paths of Pain after he was left crippled 
        during a battle with Hanzo. Unable to move or act on his own, he controlled six corpses to carry out his will as part of his "Pain" identity.
         In the anime, the first body used, belonged to his childhood friend Yahiko, which was his favourite. To match his late friend's hair colour, 
         he had the other Paths' hair dyed to the same colour, including eyebrows. Nagato's first Six Paths of Pain were composed of individuals that 
         Jiraiya had met when they were alive. Nagato implants their black receivers all over their bodies as body piercings.<br>

        Each of the Six Paths of Pain can be used to perform any technique that Nagato himself is capable of, however, he limits each body to one 
        branch of the Six Paths Techniques, the exception being Yahiko's body (the Deva Path) through which he performs a number of miscellaneous 
        jutsu; the King of Hell and the creatures summoned by the Animal Path are part of his shared vision. Nagato refers to each body by the 
        Path it embodies and has them serve specific purposes, be it offensive or defensive, reconnaissance or repair. Each of the Paths has 
        its own importance in a fight  the Naraka Path's ability to restore all the other Paths making it the most valuable  and therefore, 
        Nagato will sacrifice other Paths to protect those further up
         the hierarchy.<br>

        Konan  was a kunoichi from Amegakure and a founding member of the original Akatsuki. After Yahiko's death,
         she was partnered with Nagato, who had since taken control of Akatsuki, and was the only member to call 
         him by his name. After Nagato's death, Konan defected from Akatsuki and became the de facto village head of Amegakure.
         When she was young, Konan's family was killed during the Second Shinobi World War, and she was left to fend for herself.
          Some time later, Yahiko found her, and the two worked together to survive. Not long after that, Konan went for a walk 
          and found a young, dying Nagato and his dog, Chibi. She rescued him and brought him back to their hideout. Gradually 
          the three became best friends. They eventually encountered the Sannin, who gave them some food. Konan impressed them by
           making an elaborate flower out of the paper wrappers left behind as a sign of gratitude. When Orochimaru suggested to 
           kill them so they would not have to suffer the horrors of war, Jiraiya instead opted to stay and teach the three how to look after themselves.<br>
