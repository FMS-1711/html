        of Akatsuki who was partnered with Hidan. Kisame Hoshigaki jokingly referred to them as the Zombie Combo , due to the fact that,
         in differing senses, they could not die.<br>
         When under the servitude of Takigakure as an elite ninja, Kakuzu took on a mission to assassinate Hashirama Senju, the First Hokage. 
         This mission, however, ended in failure against the God of Shinobi. Despite the insurmountable danger faced on the mission, what 
         awaited his return to his village was the stigma and harsh punishment associated with the failure of his objective. 
         In response to this treatment, a wrong levied against a shinobi who had put life and limb on the line for his village, Kakuzu 
         came to hold a violent hatred for Takigakure as he escaped from imprisonment. In his flight from the village, Kakuzu killed the 
         village elders, took their hearts, and fled with knowledge of the village's most prized forbidden techniques. He made a living 
         off bounty hunting on the black market, and tearing out the still-beating hearts of powerful shinobi to extend his own lifespan 
         and arsenal.At some time in the past, he apparently encountered the Gold and Silver Brothers and witnessed Kinkaku's jinchÅ«riki transformation.<br>
