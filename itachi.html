        <h2 style="font-family:cursive ;"><ul><li>  Uchiha Itachi was a shinobi of Konoha's Uchiha clan
             who served as an Anbu Captain. He later became an international criminal after murdering
              his entire clan, sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the 
              international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose activity brought him into
               frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja , including Sasuke who sought to avenge
                their clan by killing Itachi. Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed
                 to be more complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the
                  interest of his brother and village, making him remain a loyal shinobi of 
                  Konoha to the very end.<br>

                                    <h2 style="font-family:cursive ;"><li> Uchiha Obito was a member of Konoha Uchiha clan.
                                         He was believed to have died during the 
                                        Third Shinobi World War, his only surviving legacy being the Sharingan he gave to 
                                        his teammate, Kakashi Hatake. In truth, Obito was saved from death and trained by 
                                        Madara, but the events of the war left Obito disillusioned with reality, and he 
                                        inherited Madara's plan to create an ideal world. Resurfacing under the names of 
                                        Tobi  and Madara Uchiha himself, Obito subtly took control of the Akatsuki, using 
                                        them as a means to advance his machinations, eventually going public and starting 
                                        the Fourth Shinobi World War. However, towards the war's conclusion, Obito had a 
                                        change of heart and, as atonement, sacrificed his life to save the same world he 
                                        sought to replace.<br>
