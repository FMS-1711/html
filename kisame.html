        Kisame Hoshigaki , feared as the Monster of the Hidden Mist , was a shinobi of Kirigakure's Hoshigaki Clan.
         After joining the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist, he became an S-rank missing-nin and was partnered with
          Itachi Uchiha when the latter joined Akatsuki.<br>
          Originally, Kisame was to guard the Cypher Division under orders from his superior, Fuguki Suikazan of the 
          Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist. When the group was cornered by Konoha-nin under Ibiki Morino during a 
          mission, Kisame chose to kill the Cypher Division members to keep their intel from being leaked out through 
          Ibiki's interrogation, as instructed by Fuguki.<br>
